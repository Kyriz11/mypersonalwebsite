  <p>Last semester when I had to do my Industrial Training, I applied to do my LI at Perpustakaan Tun Sri Lanang (PTSL), UKM Bangi. I worked there for a total of 6 weeks. For the first 2 weeks I was assigned to explore all the units at PTSL and other library branches in UKM. For the third week, I got assigned permanently to the Archive and Special Collections. So, for the entire remaining month I worked there.</p>

  <p>It was a blast as I had attended a few programs. For example, Gotong-royong, learning while visiting Academy Jawi, and a few other lectures.</p>

  <p>Our class last week had an event going on at Dewan Perdana called InfoFest. There were 6 booths that had multiple different themes. Ours was the Museum Archeology Lembah Bujang. We held exhibition containing their artifacts and history. All the other booths had their own different exhibition collabing with different companies.</p>
